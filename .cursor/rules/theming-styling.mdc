## Responsive Design & Mobile-First
- Always start with mobile layout first, then enhance for larger screens
- Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints consistently:
  - `sm:` (640px) - Small devices
  - `md:` (768px) - Medium devices
  - `lg:` (1024px) - Large devices
  - `xl:` (1280px) - Extra large devices
  - `2xl:` (1536px) - 2X large devices
- Test layouts across all breakpoints
- Use flexible units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed pixels
- Implement proper touch targets (min 44x44px) for mobile
- Consider mobile navigation patterns
- Optimize images and assets for different screen sizes
- Use proper spacing and typography scaling
- Test touch interactions and gestures
