# üèóÔ∏è Component Architecture

## Component Design
- One component per file
- Each component should have a single responsibility
- Break down complex components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Keep components focused and maintainable

## File Organization
- Components should be in their own files
- Related components should be grouped in feature folders
- Keep component files small and focused

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep component logic simple and focused
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
